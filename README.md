# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This is a Python program that visualizes sorting algorithms using Matplotlib and NumPy. The program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the user to choose which sorting algorithm to visualize.

## Installation

To use this program, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You will also need to install the following Python packages:
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Tkinter (should be pre-installed with Python 3)

You can install these packages using pip, the package installer for Python. Open a command prompt or terminal window and enter the following commands:

...
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
...

## Usage

To use the program, run the `main.py` file using Python. This will open the GUI window with a label and a button for each sorting algorithm.

Click on a button to choose which sorting algorithm to visualize. A new window will open with the animation for the selected algorithm.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are supported:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
